PS2-Packer-lite version 0.4.4
=============================

Overview
--------

  This is the lite version of PS2-Packer. See README.txt for full details
about that software. This lite version only comes with built-in ucl n2e packer
and unpackers. That means you don't need any external file to use it, if you
only want to use the n2e compression, which is what most people want to do
anyway. This is also a request, to resolve cygwin's path problems.
