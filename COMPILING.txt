 How to compile FreeMcBoot ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
*/

 1.
 First you need a builded PS2 toolchain, I suggest you this URL as tutorial
 in case you have not:
 http://lukasz.dk/playstation-2-programming/mingw-tutorial/
 
 If your environment was already builded to compile uLE v4.30 and below, you
 only need to follow step 3 to recompile your gsKit.
 
 If your environment was already builded to compile uLE versions above 4.30,
 all you need is to compile fmcb (step 5).

 Make sure your $PS2DEV and $PS2SDK environment variables are defines in your
 profile script (/etc/profile, should be already done)
  
 
 2.
 Then you need to checkout that you have latest zlib and libpng revisions
 installed in your $PS2SDK/ports folder.
 
 Log into MinGW using MSYS, 
 Get them with svn :
 	svn co svn://svn.ps2dev.org/ps2/trunk/ps2sdk-ports/zlib $PS2DEV/src/ps2sdk-ports/zlib 
 	svn co svn://svn.ps2dev.org/ps2/trunk/ps2sdk-ports/libpng $PS2DEV/src/ps2sdk-ports/libpng 

 go to the dir you get them and build (zlib first) & install :
  	cd $PS2DEV/src/ps2sdk-ports/zlib
  	make all
  	make install
  	cd $PS2DEV/src/ps2sdk-ports/libpng
  	make all
  	make install
  
 At this point zlib and libpng should now be installed in the right
 directory which is $PS2SDK/ports
 
 
 3.
 You also need the gsKit but without libjpg, libpng, libtiff support,
 so if you haven't : 
 	svn co svn://svn.ps2dev.org/ps2/trunk/gsKit $PS2DEV/gsKit

 If you were already using a modified gsKit for compiling uLE v4.30 and
 lower, then you need to rebuild gsKit without support for libjpg,
 libtiff, libpng and zlib.
  
 So if you need to build or rebuild your gsKit, replace some of the gsKit
 sources files with ones found in
 "Changed source for external projects/gsKit" (should be
 MSYS_FOLDER/1.0/local/ps2dev/gsKit).
 
 Copy fmcb sources folder in ps2sdk/samples folder 
 (MSYS_FOLDER/1.0/local/ps2dev/ps2sdk/samples/fmcb)
 
 And run the "recompile_gsKit_no_LIBpix.sh" bash script in
 "Changed source for external projects" folder:
 	cd "$PS2SDK/samples/fmcb/Changed source for external projects"
 	chmod -x recompile_gsKit_no_LIBpix.sh
 	./recompile_gsKit_no_LIBpix.sh

 At this point gsKit should now be properly installed.

 
 4.
 Finally you'll need to install the modified libcdvd 1.15 by Hiryu & Sjeep
 that you can find here (same changes as for compiling uLE are fine) :
 http://ps2dev.org/ps2/Projects/Libraries/LIBCDVD:_CD+DVD_Filing_System_for_PS2
 
 Extract files from archive to $PS2DEV/libcdvd folder (should be
 MSYS_FOLDER/1.0/local/ps2dev/libcdvd).
 
 Replace some of the libcdvd sources files with ones found in 
 "Changed source for external projects/libcdvd".

 Now you can build libcdvd :
 	cd $PS2DEV/libcdvd
 	make all   

 	
 5.	
 To compile FreeMcBoot use :
 	cd $PS2SDK/samples/fmcb
  	make all

 "make clean" is not necessary before to recompile.
 
 you will have a "bin" folder created in FreeMcBoot sources folder with
 packed installer and configurator elfs in it.
